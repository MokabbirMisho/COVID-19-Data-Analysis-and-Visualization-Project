# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize key metrics related to the COVID-19 pandemic using Python. By leveraging various datasets, the project aims to provide insights into total cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, and testing ratios among different countries.

**Tools and Libraries Used**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express
Datasets
**The project utilized the following datasets:**

country_wise_latest.csv: Contains the latest COVID-19 data for various countries.
covid_19_clean_complete.csv: Comprehensive data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
day_wise.csv: Daily aggregated data of COVID-19 cases globally.
full_grouped.csv: Grouped data of COVID-19 cases.
usa_country_wise.csv: COVID-19 data for the USA.
worldometer_data.csv: Global COVID-19 statistics.


**Key Metrics Analysis**

Total Cases
Calculated the total number of COVID-19 cases globally and visualized the distribution across countries using a treemap. This visualization helps to quickly identify which countries have the highest number of total cases.
Total Deaths

Similarly, the total number of deaths was calculated and visualized using a treemap. This allows for a comparison of the death toll across different countries.
Total Recovered Cases

The total number of recovered cases was analyzed and visualized using a treemap to understand the recovery rates across countries.
Total Active Cases

Active cases were also calculated and visualized using a treemap to identify which countries currently have the most active COVID-19 cases.

**Trend Analysis**

Aanalyzed the trend of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases over time using line charts. This visualization provides insights into how the pandemic has evolved globally over time.
Population to Tests Done Ratio
A new feature was created to calculate the ratio of population to tests done for each country. This ratio was visualized using a bar chart to highlight which countries have conducted the most tests relative to their population size.
Most Affected Countries
Bar plots were created to show the top 20 countries with the most confirmed cases, deaths, active cases, and recoveries. These visualizations help to identify the countries most impacted by the pandemic.
Pie Charts for Worst Affected Countries
Pie charts were used to visualize the distribution of total cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases for the 15 worst affected countries. This provides a clear picture of the share of these metrics among the most impacted countries.

**Ratio Analysis**

Various ratios were calculated and visualized to provide deeper insights into the severity and response to the pandemic:
Deaths to Confirmed Ratio: Visualized to show the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases.
Deaths to Recovered Ratio: Visualized to understand the proportion of deaths among recovered cases.
Tests to Confirmed Ratio: Visualized to show the number of tests conducted per confirmed case.
Serious to Deaths Ratio: Visualized to show the proportion of serious cases that resulted in death.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using various visualization techniques to uncover insights from the data. The analysis includes understanding the spread and impact of the virus across different countries, trends over time, and key ratios that highlight critical aspects of the pandemic.
